# 🌲 Complexity Analysis of Binary Search Trees (BST)  

This project focuses on analysing the **time complexity of Binary Search Trees (BSTs)** using **Big-O notation** and other asymptotic measures. It involves studying the performance of various BST operations and evaluating their efficiency.  

## 🔹 What It Does  
✅ Implements and analyses **BST operations** such as insertion, lookup, deletion and traversal  
✅ Uses **Big-O notation** to characterise best, worst and average-case complexities  
✅ Evaluates the performance trade-offs of different BST implementations  

## 📊 Analysis Report  
A detailed **Complexity Analysis Report** is included, covering:  
📌 **Time complexity analysis** of BST operations  
📌 **Justification of complexity classifications** using algorithmic principles  
📌 **Comparison of recursive vs. iterative implementations**  

## 🏆 Why It Matters  
This project deepens the understanding of **computational complexity** and **efficient data structure selection**. It demonstrates the ability to **evaluate algorithmic performance**, a critical skill in software engineering and systems optimisation.
